# Collection of Uncertain Pancakes

This is a [SciKit-GStat uncertainty extension](https://github.com/hydrocode-de/skgstat_uncertainty) project.
The extension can be used to propagate observation uncertainties into different parts of a variogram.

If you use this repository, please cite the awesome software, which made the application possible. A full
bibtex file is contained in this repository.

The `Collection of Uncertain Pankcakes` is the default and demo project for this application.  It uses demo
data from [scikit-gstat](https://github.com/mmaelicke/scikit-gstat), which is an image of a pancake. A variogram
of the spatial structure of the pancake browning is estimated and hypothetical observation uncertainties are 
propagated into the variogram and kriging application.
